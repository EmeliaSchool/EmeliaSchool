    'Ello there. Emelia here, except now I'm in school and doing stuff from my school laptop. 
    Love me some video games, Linux, and computer hardware.
    Learning C++, lil bit o' game development, and some other computer stuff. Also, Python, and hopefully soon C#, as well as Rust and Lua. Used to know Java, have since forgotten it.
    I know C, JavaScript, Bash, Powershell, and I guess Scratch if you count that.
    Lookin' to make and document cool stuff, I dunno. AGPLv3 is my favorite license, in case you couldn't tell.
